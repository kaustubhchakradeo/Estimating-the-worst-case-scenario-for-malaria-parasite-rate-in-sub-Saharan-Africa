Repository for the paper. Will not work as is. Please contact authors for data. 

For downloading Landsat images from Google Earth Engine- Use /satellite/get-all-africa-10km-images-script_country.py. You will require a csv file containing locations. 

For the contrastive learning setup- Use /Pretraining/contrastive_10_04.py. Extract feature vector embeddings for each image using /Pretraining/extract_features_full_5k_10k.py. We do not provide the dataset here. Available on request. 

For the Bayesian model and generingrealisations- Use /Predictions/0904_baseline_FINAL.r. 

For conversion of prevalence rates to incidence rates- Use /Predictions/summarize_baseline.r. 

For final plotting- Use /Predictions/final_incidence_average_cases_mapping copy.ipynb.

Supllementary plots were generated using /Extras/obsvpred.ipynb and /Extras/regression_evi.ipynb.

Please note that we do not provide data here. The images can be made available on request. The DHS data requires data controller agreements and thus cannot be shared.
